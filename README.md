# Real-Estate-Midterm
This project examines the likelihood and cost of purchasing a home in Fayetteville, NC, compared to the national average, as well as how these costs relate to the average enlisted income in the U.S. Army. Using a comprehensive approach, I combined Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) rates (with dependents) and base salary to establish an income benchmark, and compared that to housing market data sourced from Zillow.

I explored several key data sets:

-Inflation rates over the past 100 years

-National and Fayetteville-specific mortgage payment trends over the last 15 years

-Historical changes in BAH over the past 15 years

These insights were synthesized into a presentation outlining how affordable modern homes are, both locally and nationally, for the average enlisted soldier.

Key findings showed that for enlisted personnel up to the rank of E-8, current home prices exceed the affordability threshold—defined as 28% of gross income, based on widely accepted financial planning guidelines.

In addition, the project contextualized these findings within broader economic history, highlighting the role of inflation and the Federal Reserve’s policies during this period.

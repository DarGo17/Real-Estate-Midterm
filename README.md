# Real-Estate-Midterm
This project analyzes and disects the likelihood cost of purchasing a home in Fayetteville, NC compared to the national average and their current income. For assumptions I've used BAH with dependents plus base salary to establish their income level and compared that to housing data provided by zillow housing data.

Data sets that were explored included the lat 100 years of inflation rates, the last 15 years of mortgage payments nationally and around Fayetteville, NC as well as BAH changes throughout the last 15 years. This all compounded into a presentation that shows what the affordability of mordern homes are locally and nationally for the average Enlisted person in the United States Army

# Real-Estate-Midterm
This project analyzes and disects the likelihood cost of purchasing a home in Fayetteville, NC compared to the national average and their current income. For assumptions I've used BAH with dependents plus base salary to establish their income level and compared that to housing data provided by zillow housing data.

Data sets that were explored included the lat 100 years of inflation rates, the last 15 years of mortgage payments nationally and around Fayetteville, NC as well as BAH changes throughout the last 15 years. This all compounded into a presentation that shows what the affordability of mordern homes are locally and nationally for the average Enlisted person in the United States Army.

The key findings showes that until the rank of E8 homes today are above the threshold of affordability - 28% of gross income by financial advise standard.

The project expounds on historical context regarding inlfation and then explained the impact that has on larger economic princiapls in the US economy and the impact the Federal Reserve had throughout that time period.

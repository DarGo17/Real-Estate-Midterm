# Real-Estate-Midterm
This project analyzes and disects the likelihood cost of purchasing a home in Fayetteville, NC compared to the national average and their current income. For assumptions I've used BAH with dependents plus base salary to establish their income level and compared that to housing data provided by zillow housing data.
